# queue-with-hooks

The project hiva is a simple proof of concept of (hopefully synchronized) media queueing using react hooks.
This is a prototype of a mobile app which is part of a bigger chromecast project called hiva. The prototype
of how the tv would respond to the app can be found here https://github.com/MachiRic/hiva-project

A demo of the project can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWmtIqnuhitnJt2z7TgN_1RPwAOkiFMa/view?usp=sharing
More specific details of the idea will be added soon.
